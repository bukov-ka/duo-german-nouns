## Technical Specifications

### Data Source
- A JSON file (german_nouns_with_gender_and_plural.json) containing German nouns, their genders, and plural forms
- File size: approximately 53KB
- The entire file will be loaded at app startup

### User Interface
- Large text display for the current noun
- Three large buttons for gender selection: 'der', 'die', 'das'
- Color feedback: green for correct answers, red for incorrect
- A 'Continue' button that appears after each answer

### Functionality
- Randomly selects a noun from the loaded JSON data
- Presents the noun to the user
- User selects the gender by clicking one of the three buttons
- Immediate feedback is provided:
  - Correct answer: selected button turns green
  - Incorrect answer: selected button turns red, correct button turns green
- 'Continue' button appears to move to the next noun
- No score tracking or statistics

### Error Handling

## Implementation Notes
1. Use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and fast loading
2. Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
